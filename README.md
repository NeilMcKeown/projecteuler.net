Solutions for problems 1-100 on [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net)

_"However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, 
as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to
undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching
material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions
to be discussed elsewhere."_ - https://projecteuler.net/about

## Problem 1
### Multiples of 3 or 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Problem 2
### Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the 
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the 
even-valued terms.
